# Weather Dashboard

This simple Weather Dashboard uses an Open Weather API's along with Javascript, with CSS styling.
When I search a city using search for a city function, I am able to see the current weather for the city searched. The current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index is displayed along with the current date and the and an icon displaying what type of weather we are having (i.e. a sun for clear, clouds for cloudy etc.).
I am also able to see a 5 day forecast below. The date, highest temperature, humidity, wind speed and an icon is displayed. 
This homework allowed me to be a little bit more creative but I definitely cannot get out of the early 2000 aesthetic. I am understanding the Javascript more and was able to play around with Grid styling more as well.
